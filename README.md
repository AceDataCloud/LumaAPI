## Get Started


With the widespread application of AI, various AI programs have gradually become popular. AI has gradually penetrated all aspects of people's work and life. The industries involved in AI are also increasing, from the initial writing, to medical education, and now to video.

Luma is a professional high-quality video generation platform where users only need to upload materials to automatically generate high-quality videos based on different styles and effects. This AI video generator is developed by team members from well-known technology companies, aiming to allow everyone to easily create outstanding videos without complex editing tools.

However, Luma does not officially provide an API. AceDataCloud offers a set of Luma APIs that simulate the integration with Suno's official API, making it convenient and quick to generate the desired videos.

### Application and Usage

To use the Luma Videos API, you can first visit the [Luma Videos Generation API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/5bd3597d-1ff8-44ad-a580-b66b48393e7f) page and click the "Acquire" button to obtain the credentials needed for the request:

If you are not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the login page inviting you to register and log in. After logging in or registering, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

Upon the first application, there will be a free quota provided, allowing you to use the API for free.

### Basic Usage

To generate a video, you can input any text. For example, if I want to generate a video about astronauts shuttling between space and volcanoes, I can input `Astronauts shuttle from space to volcano`, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/yub02j.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The generated code is as follows:

You can click the "Try" button to directly test the API. After waiting for 1-2 minutes, the result is as follows:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "e4018a99-1522-4f24-9330-62c2a9b50b59",
  "video_id": "155838f8-7f1e-44d8-b387-192f3b4b509d",
  "prompt": "Astronauts shuttle from space to volcano",
  "video_url": "https://storage.cdn-luma.com/dream_machine/af94e7ca-da35-4b5f-a636-2d7254184d0d/watermarked_video0585de3737db946e5a0ac895384ecd180.mp4",
  "video_height": 752,
  "video_width": 1360,
  "state": "completed",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/luma/e4018a99-1522-4f24-9330-62c2a9b50b59.jpg",
  "thumbnail_width": 1360,
  "thumbnail_height": 752
}
```

We can see that we have obtained the relevant information of the video, including video ID, video link, video thumbnail, and other content.

The field descriptions are as follows:

- success: Indicates whether the generation was successful; if successful, it is `true`, otherwise it is `false`.
