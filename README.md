## Get Started


With the widespread application of AI, various AI programs have gradually become popular. AI has gradually penetrated all aspects of people's work and life. The industries involved in AI are also increasing, from the initial writing, to medical education, and now to video.

Luma is a professional high-quality video generation platform where users only need to upload materials to automatically generate high-quality videos based on different styles and effects. This AI video generator is developed by team members from well-known technology companies, aiming to allow everyone to easily create outstanding videos without complex editing tools.

However, Luma does not officially provide an API. AceDataCloud offers a set of Luma APIs that simulate the integration with Suno's official API, making it convenient and quick to generate the desired videos.

### Application and Usage

To use the Luma Videos API, you can first visit the [Luma Videos Generation API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/5bd3597d-1ff8-44ad-a580-b66b48393e7f) page and click the "Acquire" button to obtain the credentials needed for the request:

If you are not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the login page inviting you to register and log in. After logging in or registering, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

Upon the first application, there will be a free quota provided, allowing you to use the API for free.

### Basic Usage

To generate a video, you can input any text. For example, if I want to generate a video about astronauts shuttling between space and volcanoes, I can input `Astronauts shuttle from space to volcano`, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/yub02j.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The generated code is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/ieq7yn.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

You can click the "Try" button to directly test the API. After waiting for 1-2 minutes, the result is as follows:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "e4018a99-1522-4f24-9330-62c2a9b50b59",
  "video_id": "155838f8-7f1e-44d8-b387-192f3b4b509d",
  "prompt": "Astronauts shuttle from space to volcano",
  "video_url": "https://storage.cdn-luma.com/dream_machine/af94e7ca-da35-4b5f-a636-2d7254184d0d/watermarked_video0585de3737db946e5a0ac895384ecd180.mp4",
  "video_height": 752,
  "video_width": 1360,
  "state": "completed",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/luma/e4018a99-1522-4f24-9330-62c2a9b50b59.jpg",
  "thumbnail_width": 1360,
  "thumbnail_height": 752
}
```

We can see that we have obtained the relevant information of the video, including video ID, video link, video thumbnail, and other content.

The field descriptions are as follows:

- success: Indicates whether the generation was successful; if successful, it is `true`, otherwise it is `false`.
- task_id: The unique ID of this video generation task.
- video_id: The unique ID of the video generated by this task.
- prompt: The keywords for this video generation task.
- video_url: The link to the resulting video of this generation task.
- video_height: The height of the generated video thumbnail image.
- video_width: The width of the generated video thumbnail image.
- state: The status of this video generation task; if the task is completed, it is `completed`.
- thumbnail_url: The link to the generated video thumbnail image.
- thumbnail_width: The width of the generated video thumbnail image.
- thumbnail_height: The height of the generated video thumbnail image.

### Custom Start and End Frame Generation

If you want to generate a video by customizing the start and end frames, you can input the image links for the start and end frames:

At this time, the `start_image_url` field can accept the following image as the start frame of the video:

![Start Frame](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/r9vsv9.png)

Next, we need to customize the video generation based on the start and end frames and keywords, specifying the following content:

- action: The action of the video generation task, usually either normal generation `generate` or extended generation `extend`, with the default being `generate`.
- start_image_url: Specify the start frame of the generated video.
- end_image_url: Specify the end frame of the generated video.
- prompt: The keyword content for the generated video.

An example of the input is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/zvzydx.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

After filling it out, the generated code is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/tx80pu.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The corresponding code is:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/luma/videos"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "start_image_url": "https://cdn.acedata.cloud/r9vsv9.png",
    "action": "generate",
    "prompt": "Astronauts shuttle from space to volcano"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

The result obtained is as follows:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "12a18694-fd4b-47e7-9c50-34f30862cff6",
  "video_id": "0105c090-03a5-425a-8026-523341cd575b",
  "prompt": "Astronauts shuttle from space to volcano",
  "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/luma/12a18694-fd4b-47e7-9c50-34f30862cff6.mp4",
  "video_height": 656,
  "video_width": 1552,
  "state": "completed",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/luma/12a18694-fd4b-47e7-9c50-34f30862cff6.jpg",
  "thumbnail_width": 1552,
  "thumbnail_height": 656
}
```

The final result is similar to the previous one, with the generated video start frame containing the image we provided. Of course, you can also provide both start and end frame image links to generate the video; you just need to add an end frame image based on the above. The information for the end frame image is as follows:

![End Frame](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/0iad3k.png)

An example of the input is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/20igwi.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Finally, the following result is obtained:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "d1cb723a-e554-4775-94a4-bb6ae8c7ea67",
  "video_id": "6bebd0d2-f793-472e-9326-38528a9273bb",
  "prompt": "Astronauts shuttle from space to volcano",
  "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/luma/d1cb723a-e554-4775-94a4-bb6ae8c7ea67.mp4",
  "video_height": 656,
  "video_width": 1552,
  "state": "completed",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/luma/d1cb723a-e554-4775-94a4-bb6ae8c7ea67.jpg",
  "thumbnail_width": 1552,
  "thumbnail_height": 656
}
```

The result is similar to the above, and the generated video contains images of both the first and last frames, thus completing the custom first and last frame generation for the video.
